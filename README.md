### Introduction
Upon running the game, you will be met by the introduction screen, containing the PyUno Logo. This screen provides information about the number of players, the number of cards per player, the player whose turn is first, and the beginning card.

### Card Interface
During a player's turn, they will be prompted with the card interface screen. This screen displays all their cards, the last played card, and their possible actions. 
The user has two main possible actions: place a card by selecting the card number (1, 2, 3, etc.) OR DRAW, which draws a card from the deck.

### Draw Interface
When the player draws a card during their turn, they will be met by the draw interface screen. This screen shows the possible actions a player can take: play the card, save the card and end their turn, or save their card and go back to the card interface.

### Color Selection
If a player places down a Wild Card or +4 Card, they will be prompted with the color selection screen. On the screen, the player must choose the color they would like to switch to by entering in 1, 2, 3, or 4, corresponding to red, yellow, green, and blue respectively.

### End of Turn
Once a player places a card (or doesn't by ending their turn), both players will be met by the end of turn screen. On this screen, the player who was just playing should transfer the screen to the other player. The initial player should not look at the other player's screen until the end of their turn.

### UNO Declaration
Nearing the end game, when a player has one card remaining, they will quickly receive the uno declaration screen. During the time frame, the user must press the "Enter" key to declare an UNO. If the user fails to declare an UNO, they will receive two extra cards. Successful declaration will result in no punishment.

### Victory
Once a player has successfully won the game by disposing of all of their cards, all players will be met by the victory screen. This final screen displays important final information like the player who won and how close the other player(s) were to winning.
